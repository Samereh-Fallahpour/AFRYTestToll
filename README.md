This Project is designed with Blazor WebAssembly and a Web API. The project is Code First and consists of four parts. 
1- AFRY-Toll The .sln file required to run the project is located in the AFRY-Toll folder. 
2-AfryToll.Model: I have defined Dtos. 
3-AfryTollApi: In this section, I have defined the database structure and tables, as well as the necessary repositories. It also works with Swagger. 
4-AfryTollApp: This is the frontend part of the project, which is built with Blazor pages.

The overall structure is designed with two main sections: User and Admin. Small admin section that manages the toll category and its cost, 
the second part allows the user to register in the system using their license plate number. After logging in, they can pay the vehicle tolls through the system. 
This project fulfills all the requirements specified for the technical test.
